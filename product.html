				<strong> What problem does this product solve</strong>
				<p> the <em>main</em> problem this product solves is when the players or the coaches are not 
				agreeing with the referees decision on a certain matter for example a foul or offside
				in football or an situation in baseball if the player is safe or out. The reason this 
				product solves this problem is the fact that you can rewatch te situation and from 
				different angles in contrast with the moment it happens where you can only see it once
				and only from one angle</p>

				<strong> The future for this innovation </strong>
				<p> We think this innovation has a big future ahead of it. We think this because until now
				this product is almost only used in professional sport leagues, and with our product we can
				get the VAR to be used in smaller and local leagues to improve these games. This product also 
				makes ways to rewatch certain moments in a sports game for fans of the sport to rewatch after 
				the game. Because of these reasons we think that this innovation will be helpfull in the future.</p>
